    <h1>Difference between <strong><em>em</em></strong> and <strong><em>rem</em></strong> units in CSS</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>While setting the size of any element in CSS, we have two choices.<br>
            The first one is absolute units and the other is relative units.<br>
            Absolute units are fixed and not relative to anything else. They are always identical in any case.
            They involve <em><strong>cm, mm, px,</strong></em> etc.<br>
            On the other side, relative units are relative to something else.
            It may be the size of the parent element or the size of the main <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>.<br>
            Relative units cover <strong><em>em, rem, vw, vh,</em></strong> etc. These are scalable units and helps in
            responsive design.<br>
            Many of us might get confused between the relative units, especially the em and the rem units.
            Let’s break down the difference between those two.<br> Basically that both rem and em are scalable
            and relative units of size, but with em, the unit is relative to the font size of its parent
            element, while the rem unit is only relative to the root font
            size of the HTML document. The <em><strong>“r”</strong></em> in rem stands for
            <em><strong>“root”</strong></em>.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>em Unit: The em unit allows setting the font size of an element relative to the font size of its
                parent. When the size of the parent element changes, the size of the child changes automatically.
                <br> Note: When em units are used on font-size property, the size is relative
                to the font-size of the parent.
                When used on other properties, it’s relative to the font-size of that element itself.
                Here, only the first declaration takes the reference of the parent
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>rem Unit: The rem is based upon the font-size value of the root element,
                which is the html element. And if the html element doesn’t have a specified font-size,
                the browser default value of 16px is used. So here only the value of
                the root is considered, and there is no relation with a parent element.<br>
                Unlike em, here size is relative for all declarations, not only first.

    </ol>

    <p><strong>Difference between em and rem unit is given below:</strong></p>
    <table border="2">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Parameter</th>
                <th>em</th>
                <th>rem</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Relativity</strong></td>
                <td><strong>em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent</strong></td>
                <td><strong>rem is relative to the HTML (root) font-size</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Compounding Effect</strong></td>
                <td><strong>May lead to a compounding effect</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Does not lead to a compounding effect</strong></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        <strong>Hope you got a clear difference between the em and the rem units.
            It is very easy to remember,
            r in rem indicates root, is relative to the root <em><strong>(HTML) </strong></em>and em is relative to the
            parent.</strong>
