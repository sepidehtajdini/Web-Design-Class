        <p> The <em><strong> Pomeranians</strong></em> make excellent pets for older people and those who
            are busy, because they aren't an overly dependent breed.
            They are also good for apartment dwellers or homes that don't
            have a backyard.
            Because of their small size, they aren't recommended for
            families with small children who might injure them accidentally. </p>
